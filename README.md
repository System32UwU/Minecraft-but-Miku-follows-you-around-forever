Minecraft but Miku follows you around forever :3

How to install and use: (NOTE: This only works on Java Edition.)
Download "miku data pack.zip" and "miku resource pack.zip".
Copy "miku resource pack.zip" to your resource pack folder, usually at "C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks".
Open Minecraft and go to Options, Resource Packs, and load the resource pack.
Copy "miku data pack.zip" to the data pack folder in any world, the folder is usually at "C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves\world\datapacks".
Open the world in Minecraft. If cheats aren't on, then pause the game, click "Open to LAN", and turn cheats on. Type "/reload", and then "/feature miku:spawn".

The way I made this is by retexturing husks to look like Miku, so she has zombie arms, and all husks look like her, any suggestion to fix that would be appreciated. 

Good luck! ⸜(｡˃ ᵕ ˂ )⸝♡
